# NYC Taxi Ride Duration Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a regression model that accurately predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. The dataset used for this project is provided by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). It contains various features such as:

- **Pickup time**
- **Pickup and dropoff geo-coordinates**
- **Number of passengers**
- **Distance traveled**
- **Trip distance**
- **And other relevant variables**

The goal is to create a model that can estimate the ride duration based on these features, which could be beneficial for taxi companies, ride-sharing apps, or city planners to improve trip estimation, fleet management, and customer experience.

## Key Features of the Project
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and processed the raw data to handle missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data points.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized and analyzed the data to understand relationships between variables and identify key features that influence trip duration.
- **Modeling**: Developed various regression models, including linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, to predict the total ride duration.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed the performance of the models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) to ensure the best model is selected.
- **Deployment**: Built a Streamlit app to interactively explore taxi ride data and visualize predicted ride durations.
